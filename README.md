# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Project-1

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstraites **recursive thinking**, **time complexity analysis**, and the practical application of data structure and algorithm concepts through coding tasks.


## 🧩 Part 1 – String Decoding

two approaches for decoding a custom string format, where patterns like `3(a)` or `2(bv)` indicate repetition.

### ✅ Implementations:

* **Recursive Method**: A recursive function to parse and expand the encoded string.
* **Non-Recursive Method**: An iterative solution using stack-based parsing.

### 🧠 Time Complexity:

* Detailed theoretical analysis included in the PDF documentation.

**Example Input**: `3(a)2(bv)cb`
**Output**: `aaabvbvcb`



## 🔍 Part 2 – Search Algorithm Comparison

Three search algorithms were implemented and analyzed:

1. **Linear Search**
2. **Binary Search**
3. **Ternary Search**

Each algorithm was tested over randomly generated arrays with sizes ranging from 10 to 10,000. The number of operations required to find a random element was recorded and plotted.

### 📊 Analysis:

* Operation counts were collected.
* `operation vs. elements` growth charts were generated for each algorithm.
* Complexity discussed and compared (O(n), O(log n), etc.)
